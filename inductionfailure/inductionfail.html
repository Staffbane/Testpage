	<h2> Bookings </h2>
	<p>The fundraising committee is pleased because the hall has proved to be extremely popular and therefore lucrative.</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage the number of bookings that are coming in and to ensure that payments have been made.<p> 
	<br></br>
	<p>Although the hall is well used, there are times when it is not in use. The committee would like to have a better understanding of what the hall is being used for, how much revenue is being generated and who is using it.</p> 
	<br></br>
	<p>At the last fundraising committee meeting, members voted to allocate some funding to commission a computer application to manage the business created by the sports hall.</p> 
	<br></br>
	<p>The committee members are extremely busy people and it was decided that it would be convenient to be able to access the application over the Internet. </p>
	<h3>Badminton</h3>
	<p>Hire one of our courts and enjoy a social game with friends. 
	<p>Court prices start from as little as £6.10 (off peak) or £9.95 (peak), discounts are available for senior and juniors.</p> 
	<p>Don’t worry if your just getting started and don’t have a racket, we offer a full range of racket hire for all sports, from just £1.35.</p> 
	<p>What’s more, we can even find you a playing partner, with our great No Strings badminton sessions, see special offers page for more details. </p>
	<p>Adult and Junior Coaching sessions are also available for players looking to improve their skills and technique. </p> 
	<p>Badminton Court Measurements / Dimensions / Size: Total Length of the badminton court 44 feet, Total Width of the court for Singles play 17 feet, Total Width of the court for Doubles play 20 feet. </p>
	<p>Distance of Sideline (for singles play) from the outer side edge of the court 1 feet 6 inches when measured inwards from the side edge. Distance of Backline from the back boundary line 2 feet 6 inches when measured inwards from the back boundary. </p>
	<p>Distance of the Short Service Line from the net 6 feet 6 inches from the net.</p> 
	<p>The Center Line Extends from the short service line to the back boundary on each side of the court, and is parallel to, and measured 10 feet inwards from the outer side edge.</p> 
	<p>The lines that are marked on the court are 40 mm thick and white. </p>
	<p>The net at the center of the badminton court is 5 feet (1.524 metres) high and at the extreme ends of the court (over the sidelines for doubles) is 5 feet 1 inch (1.55 metres)</p>
	<p>Our sports hall can cater for all our indoor cricket needs, providing full batting and bowling netting and matting for your practice sessions. </p>
	<p>Prices from as little as £59.60 per hour. Indoor cricket nets differ significantly from outdoor nets.</p> 
	<p>They are suspended on an aluminium track way (runners) which are fixed to the ceiling of sports hall or gymnasium.</p> 
	<p>The nets can then drop 8–4 metres to reach the ground, before travelling at least 20 metres laterally, which provides a substantial practise enclosure. </p>
	<p>Indoors nets are commonly multi lane, with 2 or 4 bay nets being particularly common, we have 3.</p>
	<p>Unlike outdoor cricket nets where the netting is black, indoor nets tend to be white.</p> 
	<p>They have a separate canvas screen which enclose the area immediately surrounding the batsman and rise to a height of 3 metres. </p> 
	<p>The purpose of this is twofold; the netting to the sides and rear of the batsman has by far the highest work rate, canvas is significantly more durable to tradition mesh netting and as such the use of screens improves the life span of the net.</p> 
	<p>The second is from a simply privacy aspect - the impression of seclusion allows for more focused batsman and reduces the risk of distractions. </p>
	<p>Indoor cricket nets will be found in almost all sports halls and gyms where the suspension on runners provides a curtain type system for the nets and allows the nets to be pulled in and out of use.</p>
	<p>We have 3 cricket clubs who book them for practice.  Don’t let rain stop play, hire one of our courts for short tennis.</p> 
	<p>Using full tennis rules, but played over a badminton court, this version of the game is fun and frantic, ideal for junior players, or just on those rainy days!</p>
	<p>Courts start from as little as £6.10 (off peak) or £9.95 (peak), discounts are available for senior and juniors. </p> 
	<p>Test your lightening fast reflexes with a game of table tennis. Table Tennis is a breathtaking game which involves a blend of power, skill and speed, no wonder it the biggest participation sports in the world. </p>
	<p>Grab your slice of the action by hiring on of our tables for a 40 minute session. Courts start from as little as £5.10 (off peak) or £8.25 (peak), discounts are available for senior and juniors. </p>
